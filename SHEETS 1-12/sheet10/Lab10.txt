Lab10 Exercises:
--------------

1.

Create an application for Paula’s Portraits, a photography studio. The application
allows users to compute the price of a photography session. Paula’s base price is
$40 for an in-studio photo session with one person. The in-studio fee is $75 for a
session with two or more subjects, and $95 for a session with a pet. A $90 fee is
added to take photos on location instead of in the studio. Include a set of mutually
exclusive check boxes to select the portrait subject and another set for the session
location. Include labels as appropriate to explain the application’s functionality.
Save the file as JPhotoFrame.java.

2.

Write an application for Lambert’s Vacation Rentals. Use separate
ButtonGroups to allow a client to select one of three locations, the number
of bedrooms, and whether meals are included in the rental. Assume that
the locations are parkside for $600 per week, poolside for $750 per week, or
lakeside for $825 per week. Assume that the rentals have one, two, or three
bedrooms and that each bedroom greater than one adds $75 to the base price.
Assume that if meals are added, the price is $200 more per rental. Save the file
as JVacationRental.java.
