Lab11 Exercises:
--------------

1.

Write a JavaFX application that allows the user to choose insurance options. Use
a ToggleGroup to allow the user to select only one of two insurance types—HMO
(health maintenance organization) or PPO (preferred provider organization).
Use CheckBoxes for dental insurance and vision insurance options; the user
can select one option, both options, or neither option. As the user selects each
option, display its name and price in a text field; the HMO costs $200 per month,
the PPO costs $600 per month, the dental coverage adds $75 per month, and the
vision care adds $20 per month. Save the application as FXInsurance.java.

2.

Design a JavaFX application for the Sublime Sandwich Shop. The user makes
sandwich order choices from list boxes, and the application displays the price.
The user can choose from three main sandwich ingredients of your choice (for
example, chicken) at three different prices. The user also can choose from three
different bread types (for example, rye) from a list of at least three options.
Save the application as FXSandwich.java.
